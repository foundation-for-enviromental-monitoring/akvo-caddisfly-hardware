Description:
Optimized-Assembly Branch is a branch for design revisions that are major 
and cannot be incorporated into the current production mold tools. These are 
preparations for when a new mold tool can be procured.

Changes:
- Simplified design for easier assembly.
- One large barrel_lower_o in which the cuvette_ slides in first.
- Then the barrel_upper_o (in which mesh has been affixed) slides into barrel_lower_o and mates with cuvette_o
- Cuvette has minimal changes. lid and mesh are unchanged.
